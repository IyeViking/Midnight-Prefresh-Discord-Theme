# Midnight Prefresh
A pre-refresh familiar, QOL, rounded discord theme.

A tweaked and edited version of [Midnight](https://refact0r.github.io/midnight-discord/) by refact0r

Vencord/Detterdiscord (or client that supports theme files)
Download the theme file, [Prefresh-Midnight.theme.css](https://github.com/IyeViking/Midnight-Prefresh-Discord-Theme/releases), it's in a .zip file since Github won't let me upload a .css file to releases.
Drag the file into your theme folder. (there should be a button to open the theme folder in theme settings)
