# Midnight Prefresh
A pre-refresh familiar, QOL, rounded discord theme that mimics the old colours from before the Visual Refresh.

A tweaked and edited version of [Midnight](https://refact0r.github.io/midnight-discord/) by refact0r

Installation:

-Vencord / BetterDiscord (or client that supports theme files)

-Download the theme file, [Prefresh-Midnight.theme.css](https://github.com/IyeViking/Midnight-Prefresh-Discord-Theme/blob/main/midnight-prefresh.theme.css), (there's a ... button at the top right with a download option)

-Drag the file into your theme folder. (The "Themes" menu should have a "open folder" button)
